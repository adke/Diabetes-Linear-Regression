# Diabetes-Linear-Regression

### This project is a machine learning model that represents Linear-Regression. The model has been created using Google Colab and a dataset has been imported from scikit-learn. Essentially, the model predicts a quantative measure of disease progression after one year based on ten baseline variables including, age, sex, body mass index, average blood pressure, and six blood serum measurements. 

### For best user experience, ensure that multiple Google Colab tabs are not open as this project uses Google's virtual computer with limited RAM, Disk Storage, and GPU power on the cloud. This will not be a big problem for users with Colab Pro or Colab Pro + premium plans however, it is still recommended to minimize Colab tabs for optimal model performance. 

### Finally, please make sure that you run the cells on Google Colab from Beginning to End. Otherwise, you will recieve an error at runtime.
